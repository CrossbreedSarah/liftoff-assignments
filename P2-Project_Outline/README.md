## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I am going to make an app that will allow users to make appointments for a salon. There will be a main sign in page,
 it will have 2 options to choose from in a drop down menu: client or stylist. You will sign in with an email, username
  and a password.

 On the client side:
 They will be able to login, make an appointment, select a prefered stylist or the previous stylist, select the services
  offered from that stylist. The app should save the time the client picked, show the services chosen and calculate the
  total time needed from the services provided.

On the stylist side:
They can view their appointments, see who the client is, see what services they are requesting, add notes about the
service or client, upload a profile picture, add/ remove a pic, (?? upload a schedule), add/remove services.

### Features

Login: 2 different login pages: stylist and client.
Profile page: once logged in view their profile page.
